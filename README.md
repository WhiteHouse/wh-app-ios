# White House for iOS mobile application

A native iOS app designed to fetch, cache, and display multiple feeds
containing articles, photos, and live and on demand video. These are
displayed in a web view. Includes support for push notifications.
 
This application is under active development and will continue to be
modified and improved over time.
 
## Goals

By releasing the source code for this app we hope to empower other
governments and organizations to build and release mobile apps to
engage their own citizens and constituencies. In addition, public
review and contribution to the application's code base will help
strengthen and improve the app.
 
## Requirements

1. iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch iOS version 5.1 or later
2. RSS feeds for content to be aggregated and displayed by the app
     
## Usage

Mobile developers will be able to configure the application to
retrieve and display content from arbitrary RSS feeds. The developer
will be able to configure the app to receive push
notifications. Placeholder assets may be replaced to customize the
app's look and feel.

Building the app requires the iOS 5.1 SDK or higher.

This app makes use of several libraries in source, binary, and
submodule form. All libraries live in the `libs/` directory.

The following sections describe all of the libraries and any steps
necessary to initialize them.

### Source

The following libraries are directly included as source code:

* [CustomBadge][]
* [DTCustomColoredAccessory][]
* [Zepto.js][]
* [Underscore.js][]

### Submodules

The following libraries are included as submodules:

* [SVPullToRefresh][]
* [Nimbus][]
* [Facebook SDK for iOS][fb]

To intialize submodules, run:

    git submodule update --init

To build Facebook, `cd` into `libs/facebook` and run
`./scripts/build_facebook_ios_sdk_static_lib.sh`. This will build the
static library used by the app.

### Binary Libraries

The following libraries must be downloaded and installed manually:

* [libUAirship][] - Urban Airship library for iOS
* [Google Analytics SDK for iOS][ga]

To install Urban Airship, download the SDK and place the entire
`Airship` directory inside of `libs/`.

To install Google Analytics, download the SDK and place the entire
`Google Analytics SDK` directory inside of `libs/`.

### Feeds

The app's content is pulled in from RSS feeds.

A thumbnail image is displayed in feed list views when the source 
feed <item> has a <media:thumbnail> element. The "width" attribute 
is required; the parser currently ignores thumbnail elements with no width. 

Example:

    <item>
         <media:thumbnail url="http://www.whitehouse.gov/example-image-320px.jpg" width="320"/>
         <media:thumbnail url="http://www.whitehouse.gov/example-image-640px.jpg" width="640"/>
    </item>

The optimal size for display is chosen depending on the context (e.g. 640px 
for article feeds on the iPhone 4, or ~70px for photo gallery thumbnails on the 
iPhone 3GS) and screen density.

### Search

Search functionality on WhiteHouse.gov and in the White House for iOS 
mobile app relies on USASearch, a hosted site search service provided by 
the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). Federal, state, local, 
tribal, or territorial government websites may use this service at no cost. 
For details on incorporating USASearch into .Gov sites, or for examples of 
the API and how it functions, see  [USASearch: About](http://usasearch.howto.gov/about-us)
and  [USASearch: How (and When) to Use the Search API](http://usasearch.howto.gov/post/36743437542/how-and-when-to-use-the-search-api).



NOTE: Setting up the application and configuring it for use in your
organization's context requires iOS development experience. The
application ships with a similar design to what is used in the White
House for iOS mobile application. The application ships with "white
label" placeholder assets that should be replaced by the developer.
